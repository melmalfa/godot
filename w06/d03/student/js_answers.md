What basic concept is JavaScript missing? input nor output- a connection to the outside world. Lives inside a box and depends upon the container to have everything. Browser controls what comes in and out. So it is javascript along with its environment. Node provides container and provides inputs and outputs. Built to be in the browser- lives in the broser. Node ports it out. This was important when there was s big distnction between websites and applications but now we use web applications. The language of class of what is going on within the broswer is JS. Node is a facilitarot - a container that allows js to run inside of it.

Is JavaScript Object Oriented? Yes. It is not primarily object-oriented. If you use methods, it's object- oreitned. if you use functions, primarily functional. if you use prpocedure, is procedural. So we can use JS in a functional way. Primarily functional.
What are the main differences between JavaScript and most other languages? No classes. (prototypal) No inputs/outputs. Functions are objects, so objects (which can be passed around) can hold executable code (fairly unique). Needs a container to provide inuts/outputs to outside world.
What are the types in JavaScript?
Number, String, Boolean, Object (Function, Array, Date, RegExp), Null, Undefined, NaN.
Never use symbols.
Atomic: data types: numbers, strings, boolean, null, undefined, Nan).
Data structures: (arrays, objects)
Nil: null, undefined, Nan
JS objects are the same as Ruby hashes.
What is NaN? "Not a Number" - this is returned if a string is non-numberic.
How do you convert a string into a number? Use the built-in parseInt() function. Takes the base for conversaion as the second argument.
Ex.
> parseInt("123", 10)
234
How do you find the length of a string? "string_name".length
What is the difference between null and undefined?
What values are "false" in JavaScript?
What's the keyword to declare a variable?
