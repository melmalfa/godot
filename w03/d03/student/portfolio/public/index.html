          <p>Technically I own some animals. They live back in Florida with my roommates, at my house, in my community, at HOME, where I am temporarily not. Other people named my animals:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>red (a grey and white cat)</li>
            <li>blue (an all grey cat, brother of red)</li>
            <li>bernie (a st. bernard lookalike)</li>
          </ul>
            <p>Here's Bernie, and the sunset, with my 89-year-old father:
