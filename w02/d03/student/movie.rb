# hey instructors! so I made part 1 and 2 work perfectly - yay! and now i realize i don;t know how you could see this, since i had to change and add and remove to keep moving on. i got to this last part of 3 and i couldn't figure out how to to the following (create a person object returned by movie.director) but i tried a bunch of different things, so now i am - yes- giving up and moving on to next problem as i want to learn and not bang my head against the . . . table. :)

# movie.director = "Richard Ayoade" # >> "Director can only be set to a Person object!"
# movie.director #=> still nil!
# ```
